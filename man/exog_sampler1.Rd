\title{Sample exogenous sequence IDs using a time stratified design and including close genetic distance to a regional sample}
\usage{
exog_sampler1(md, n, D, region_sample, exclusion_rules = list(), dedup = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{md}{data frame with gisaid metadata}

\item{n}{sample size}

\item{D}{distance matrix between sequences}

\item{region_sample}{vector of sequence IDs from region}

\item{exclusion_rules}{Optional list of rules of the form c( <meta data column> , <regular expression> ). Where this pattern matches, a sequence will not be included in the sample}

\item{dedup}{If TRUE will not include identical sequences}
}
